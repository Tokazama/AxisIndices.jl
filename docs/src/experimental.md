# Experimental

Currently there are several experimental modules included.
Methods from these modules are not exported by default but may be accessed by `using AxisIndices.<NameOfExperimentalModule>`
These are considered experimental because the are either undergoing rapid change, are likely to end up in a different package entirely, or both.

## ObservationDims

```@autodocs
