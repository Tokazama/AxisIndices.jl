# Acknowledgments

This package is the result of many people providing input to make it successful.
Hopefully, it will continue to be a product of such collaborations.
The following is an incomplete list of individuals who have helped me in some way get this package started.
It's mainly a list of people who have tolerated my incessant queries into many minor details that led to this package.
